Heart Disease Prediction:
I discovered that the dataset was clean and had no missing data.
I carried out a descriptive statistics summary of the dataset. I found it had outliers: In the resting blood pressure, cholesterol, max. heart rates and thalassemia.

Then categorised the age group into: elderly, adult, old adult and youths.
I carried out Exploratory Data analysis of the dataset (univariate, bivariate, and multivariate) to discover patterns, relationships, and insights.

Technologies Used: Python
My Role: I used machine learning models to predict whether patients had heart disease or not. Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifiers and 6 others to carry out the predictions. 
Random Forest Classifier predicted accurately with a precision rate of 87% of the patients had heart disease. 
Comparing the Confusion Matrix of Random Forest with Logistic Regression to Optimize (Reduce Error), Random Forest predicted more correctly when compared with Logistic Regression.
